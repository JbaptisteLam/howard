description=fitCons score predicts the fraction of genomic positions belonging to a specific function class (defined by epigenomic fingerprint) that are under selective  pressure. Scores range from 0 to 1, with a larger score indicating a higher proportion of  nucleic sites of the functional class the genomic position belong to are under selective  pressure, therefore more likely to be functional important. Integrated (i6) scores are integrated across three cell types (GM12878, H1-hESC and HUVEC). More details can be found in doi:10.1038/ng.3196.
